//
//     NPC1: Something something
//     Something2
//
// and Something2 belongs to NPC1. Read one line at a time, as this used to be, it
// became an entry of its own with nobody's name on it and drew as a second
// speaker behind a blank portrait. A line that is not a name line now joins the
// entry above it instead, so the count in the section badge goes on counting
// thoughts rather than lines.
//
// Only two things end an entry: a new name line, and the end of the block. A
// blank line is not one of them. A model that writes a thought as two paragraphs
//
//     NPC1: Text text.
//
//     text.
//
// means both paragraphs as NPC1's, and treating the gap as a boundary put the
// second one on screen under a blank portrait with nobody's name on it. The gap
// is kept as a gap - the entry carries a blank line at that point and draws with
// the paragraph break in it - but it does not break the attribution. A run of
// several blank lines is one break, and blank lines at the end of a block leave
// nothing behind.

//
//   A line that IS a name line always starts a new speaker, blank line in front of

//   to sixty characters, no colon of its own — so a long sentence with a colon in
//   the middle of it joins the thought above it instead of becoming a character
//   with a sentence for a name. Nothing that was read as a name before is refused
//   now; the bound only reaches past where a name can plausibly end.
//
//   A block whose first line has no name on it keeps that line with no name
//   against it, and anything under it joins that same unattributed entry. There is
//   nothing above it to belong to, and taking the name from the speaker further
