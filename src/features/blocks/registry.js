// BLOCK REGISTRY — one definition per block the <Blocks> envelope can carry
// -------------------------------------------------------------
//
// A block used to be defined in six places at once: a template in database.js, a
// trigger in the dict builder, a strip pattern in the cleaner, a pattern in the
// side panel's parsers, a section in sections.js and a special case or two on
// top. This is the one place now.
//
// `source` is the dict tag the block's content still comes from, which is what
// keeps engine overrides, custom prompts and the compact World State logic
// working untouched — the envelope assembles what those already produced rather
// than owning a second copy of every template.
//
// `selfWrapped` marks content that already carries its own tags (the Story
// Tracker template opens and closes <Story_Tracker> itself). Everything else is
// wrapped in `tag` at assembly time.
//
// `slot` is for a block the model emits conditionally rather than every turn: the
// envelope carries the instruction line instead of a template, and the model
// fills it in only when the block's own rules fire.
//
// `desc` is one line telling the READER what the block does, shown when they are
// deciding whether to add it. Distinct from the template, which tells the MODEL what
// to write. Optional -- a block without one simply shows no tooltip.
