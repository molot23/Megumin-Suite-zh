// Megumin Suite — per-block treatments

//

// A block body is a template the model filled in, so it is structured text

// pretending to be prose. These turn four of them into the thing they already

// are: World State into a scene board, Inner Chatter into a whisper thread,

// and the Character Sheet's list fields into chips and a pack list.

//

// EVERY TREATMENT FOLLOWS THE CYOA CONTRACT. A parse function returns null the

// moment the body stops looking like what it expects, and the pane falls back

// to renderBody() — the plain markdown the card has always drawn. That is not

// politeness, it is the only thing that makes this safe: the model drifts from

// the template constantly, and a half-parsed World State that silently drops

// four fields is worse than the paragraph it replaced.

//

// So the rule for anything added here: when in doubt, return null. A block that

// renders as prose has lost a nicety. A block that renders as a confident,

// incomplete card has lost the reader's data.

//

// This file imports only text.js and knows nothing about SillyTavern, the

// profile or the registry — it is handed a block id and a string.

//

// The failure is safe in both directions. A body wrongly called the template
