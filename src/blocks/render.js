/*
 * Megumin Suite — Master Block renderer
 *
 * SillyTavern's sanitizer strips unknown tags out of the rendered DOM but leaves
 * their text behind, and the raw text stays in message.mes. So there is no
 * <World_State> element to find and restyle: the blocks arrive on screen as
 * loose paragraphs at the end of the message, and the tags that named them are
 * already gone by the time anything here runs.
 *
 * This file therefore works from mes, not from the DOM. It reads the blocks out
 * of the raw text, hides the paragraphs the sanitizer left behind, and appends
 * one card built from what it parsed.
 *
 * Two rules everything here follows:
 *
 *   Never rewrite mes.       Stored text stays canonical, so swipes, edits,
 *                            regeneration and the summariser all keep seeing
 *                            exactly what the model wrote.
 *   Fail visible.            Anything unexpected and the message is left the way
 *                            SillyTavern rendered it. That is the behaviour from
 *                            before this file existed, so the worst outcome is
 *                            "no improvement" and never "lost content".
