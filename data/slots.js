// MEGUMIN_SLOT_REGISTRY — every [[placeholder]] the engine knows about.
//
// This is the same idea as MEGUMIN_BLOCK_REGISTRY, applied to the other half of
// the system. A placeholder used to be declared in three hand-maintained lists:
//
//   1. a createOverrideBlock(...) call in ui/devmode.js       (the editor box)
//   2. an entry in the overrides[] array in buildBaseDict.js  (the actual wiring)
//   3. a string in the 60-tag cleanup array in injection.js   (the leak guard)
//
// Only #2 was load-bearing, so forgetting #1 meant an uneditable slot and
// forgetting #3 meant a raw "[[whatever]]" leaking into the model's context.
// Three edits, three chances to miss one, and two of the three failures are
// silent. Everything is now derived from the one entry below.
//
// Adding a placeholder means adding ONE object here. If you find yourself
// editing devmode.js or the cleanup list to introduce a slot, stop — the thing
// you are about to hand-write is meant to be derived.
